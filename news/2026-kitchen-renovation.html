    <h1>Kitchen Renovation: A Complete Transformation</h1>

    <article>
        <p>Sometimes the best projects are the ones closest to home. This kitchen renovation combined technical
            precision with design sensibility, turning an outdated space into a modern, functional heart of the home.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/kitchenrenoimages/IMG_2421 Large.jpeg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1280"

            <p class="image-caption">Before: The starting point for a complete transformation.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The project started with demo—stripping everything down to the studs to address underlying electrical and
            plumbing systems. Like refactoring legacy code, sometimes you need to go back to the foundation to build
            something that lasts.</p>

        <div class="grid">

                <img src="assets/kitchenrenoimages/IMG_1988 Large.jpeg" alt="Kitchen framing and rough-in work"

                    height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-lightbox="true" role="button" tabindex="0"
                    aria-haspopup="dialog"
                    style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The rebuild phase required careful planning and execution. New cabinets, countertops, lighting, and flooring
            all had to work together as a cohesive system—not unlike architecting a multi-tier web application.</p>

        <p>The custom wood countertops presented unique engineering challenges. I chose rubberwood—a sustainable,
            durable hardwood that's often overlooked but offers excellent workability and strength. At around $200 for
            the material, it was an economical choice that didn't sacrifice quality. The 2.1-inch thick slabs required
            routing on the underside to accommodate an undermount sink—creating a recessed pocket that allowed the sink
            to sit flush despite the beefiness of the material. Every offcut was saved and repurposed: smaller sections
            were precisely fitted into the sink's accessory rails, transforming wasted material into functional counter
            space extensions.</p>

                Blend.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The finishing process mattered as much as the construction. I used Real Milk Paint's Half & Half Tung Oil
            with Citrus Blend—a food-safe finish that blends Pure Tung Oil with biodegradable, food-grade citrus
            solvent. The thinned viscosity allows deep penetration into the wood grain while maintaining durability, and
            the natural citrus aroma made the application process far more pleasant than traditional finishes.</p>

        <p>From concept to completion, this renovation reinforced a key principle that applies to both physical and
            digital projects: attention to detail at every phase produces results that stand the test of time.</p>
