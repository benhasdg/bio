    <h1>Hands-on Operations: The Stone Paver Patio Project</h1>

    <article>
        <p>Operational efficiency isn't just a digital concept—it's a philosophy that translates directly to the
            physical world. In the summer of 2020, I applied these principles to a significant home infrastructure
            project: building a multi-level stone paver patio from scratch.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/patio-final.jpg" alt="Final completed stone paver patio with a large Monstera plant"
                width="1280" height="960" decoding="async" data-lightbox="true" role="button" tabindex="0"
                aria-haspopup="dialog">
            <p class="image-caption">The finished product: A robust, multi-level outdoor operations hub.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The project began with a completely raw site. Like any complex system overhaul, the first phase was
            "deconstruction"—clearing the area and preparing the ground for a new architectural foundation. Proper
            drainage and site grading were the primary technical requirements, necessitating a precise slope to move
            water away from the house foundation.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/patio-before.jpg" alt="Original raw site before construction" width="1280" height="960"
                loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-lightbox="true" role="button" tabindex="0"
                aria-haspopup="dialog">
            <p class="image-caption">The starting point: Site clearing and initial grading.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Phase two involved establishing the retaining wall using heavy-duty masonry blocks. This wall provides the
            structural integrity needed to support the elevated patio surface. I backfilled the wall with crushed stone
            and laid a multi-layered base, tamping each layer to ensure a zero-settlement surface.</p>

        <div class="grid">
            <div>
                <img src="assets/patio-progress-1.jpg" alt="Construction progress showing the retaining wall"
                    width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-lightbox="true" role="button"
                    tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px;">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="assets/patio-progress-3.jpg" alt="Construction progress showing the completed wall and base"
                    width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-lightbox="true" role="button"
                    tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px;">
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The "tech stack" for this project was heavy on physical tools: levels, tamping plates, and a whole lot of
            manual labor. Hand-laying the final pavers required a "pixel-perfect" attention to detail, ensuring every
            block was seated correctly to maintain the integrity of the pattern.</p>

        <p>Hand-laying the final pavers required a "pixel-perfect" attention to detail. Every block had to be seated
            correctly to maintain the integrity of the pattern and the slope. The result is a durable, functional space
            that stands as a testament to the power of building things right the first time.</p>
